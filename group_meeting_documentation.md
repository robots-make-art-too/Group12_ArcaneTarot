# Discussion Log

- Discussed how the markers and cards could be seen and distributed with mass-audience in mind.  Pondered making physical cards with the markers on them to distribute, or to place around campus.

- Alternatively, markers and the QR code to the site can be printed and placed around campus.  The marker won't say which card the viewer will recieve, so that contributes to a surprise element present in Tarot readings.
