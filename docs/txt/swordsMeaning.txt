Stay focused and resolute, for you are about to reach your objective.
Wait until the timing is right and all the facts are clear before taking action.
It might be healthier to disentangle yourself and start fresh.
Concentrate less on the opinions and biases of others. Be open to intuition and insight from a deeper source.
Challenge the pessimism of others around you by evoking their higher nature.
Others will be grateful that you responded quickly to the need for immediate action.
Discipline yourself to stay focused on the desired outcome and you will make your way past all competing circumstances.
Rise to the occasion with confidence in your talent and ability.
Honestly admit to yourself that you have sacrificed time and energy on a situation that simply does not work.
Protect yourself while the storm rages and focus on rebuilding after it passes.
Circumstances call for anonymous action even if you would prefer to receive credit.
Refine your communication and negotiation skills so you are at peak effectiveness.
Make your own decisions. Exercise as much independence as you know you can handle.
Listen to the inner wisdom offered by the wise elder that dwells inside of you.
